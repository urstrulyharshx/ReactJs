Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
A simple timer component built using React. This component displays the elapsed time in seconds and provides a button to stop the timer. It utilizes React hooks (useState and useEffect) to manage state and side effects, demonstrating a basic implementation of a timer functionality in a React application.
